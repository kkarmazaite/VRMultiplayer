“Virtuali stovykla” is a virtual reality game designed for Google Cardboard and Android phones. This is a cooperative game and it can hold a maximum amount of four players. It requires an internet connection and a gyroscope sensor in order to play it.

This game is my Bachelor’s project and I used it to examine the kind of problems this kind of games would face. The game itself was created using Unity gaming engine and it was programmed with C#.

The purpose of the game is to collect the required amount of food and firewood and build up the bon fire. 

Though the menu is controlled by touch, but the actual game is controlled only using the head movement and gaze.
